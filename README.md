Our attempt at making a interactive game using Tap

# Description

During February of 2020, my friend and I attended HackCU Boulder.  
We worked with a another student to develop a Unity game that would work with a special device called the Tap Strap 2.  
The game was a piano type game where blocks come towards the player and the device needs to be tapped according to the blocks.

# Info
We had issues using the API for Tap, and it was our first Hackathon, so we decided to use it as an input device to mimic a piano game.
Each press of the fingers represents a different letter, so each letter connects to the specific piano keys being pressed.
