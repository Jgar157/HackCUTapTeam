Our attempt at making a interactive game using Tap

# Description

During February of 2020, my friend and I attended HackCU Boulder.  
We worked with a local student to develop a Unity game that would work with a special device called the Tap Strap 2.  
The game was a piano type game where blocks come towards the player and the device needs to be tapped according to the blocks.
